            <h1>How to get started with Competitive Programming?</h1>
            <br><br>
            <h2>What is Competitive Programming?</h2>
            <p>Competitive programming is a programming sport involving many participants from different region to compete with each other to achieve better result in programming. It helps in enhancing one's mind and develop analyticla and thinking skills.
                It is more common now then ever before. Programming is more common now than ever before. There is currently an active, now every week some online contest is happening for Competitive programming
            </p>
            <h2>Where to Start with Competitive programming</h2>
            <p>With so many online sites and resources it’s very natural that one will be confused. So, to make things easier I will be going through some of the most popular sites for competitive programming and mention their specialities so that you can
                decide yourself which one suits you the best.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/">SPOJ</a></li>
                <li><a href="/">CODEFORCES</a></li>
                <li><a href="/">CODECHEF</a></li>
                <li><a href="/">HAKERRANK</a></li>

            </ul>
            <h1>Mistake That Beginners make</h1>
            <h2>Getting Demotivated Easily</h2>
            <p>In the beginning it is possible that you spend a complete day on a problem and still not be able to solve it. You may lose confidence, but think this way, every time you are not able to solve a problem and check the solution you learn something
                new. Next time you will be able to solve the question that requires that concept yourself.</p>
            <h2>Procrastination</h2>
            <p>A habit that a lot of programmers have. Think of the regret you will have when you see a question in a contest that requires a concept which you have been procrastinating to learn. So it’s always better to learn something that you have been
                planning to, as soon as possible and not delay it for long.</p>
            <h2>Not Challenging yourself</h2>
            <p>Whenever you read a new algorithm or an editorial it’s very important that you implement it yourself. ‘You don’t know an algorithm unless you can code it yourself ’. If you don’t implement it yourself you will soon forget it. Try to practice
                2–3 questions from that topic.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>At the end i would like to say that competitive programming is just like a sport, as in every sport some people may like it, some may not, some may find it difficult to play with but as in every sport it is, if you wish to become good in it,
                practice and sheer practice is the the only key. That’s all you need to know for a start, I hope you enjoyed this article and will find it useful. Stay tuned for some more amazing content.</p>
